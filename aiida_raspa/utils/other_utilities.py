    :attr:`.BaseRestartWorkChain._error_handlers` attribute of the workchain. During failed calculation handling the
    :meth:`.inspect_calculation` outline method will call the `_handle_calculation_failure` which will loop over all
    error handler in the :attr:`.BaseRestartWorkChain._error_handlers`, sorted with respect to the priority in reverse.
    If the workchain class defines a :attr:`.BaseRestartWorkChain._verbose` attribute and is set to `True`, a report
    message will be fired when the error handler is executed.
    Requirements on the function signature of error handling functions. The function to which the
    decorator is applied needs to take two arguments:
        * `self`: This is the instance of the workchain itself
        * `calculation`: This is the calculation that failed and needs to be investigated
    The function body should usually consist of a single conditional that checks the calculation if
    the error that it is designed to handle is applicable. Although not required, it is advised that
    the function return an :class:`.ErrorHandlerReport` tuple when its conditional was met. If an error was handled
    it should set `is_handled` to `True`. If no other error handlers should be considered set `do_break` to `True`.
    :param cls: the workchain class to register the error handler with
    :param priority: optional integer that defines the order in which registered handlers will be called
        during the handling of a failed calculation. Higher priorities will be handled first. If the priority is `None`
        the handler will not be automatically called during calculation failure handling. This is useful to define
        handlers that one only wants to call manually, for example in the `_handle_sanity_checks` and still profit
        from the other features of this decorator.
